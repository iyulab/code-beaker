# Welcome to CodeBeaker

We're excited to introduce **CodeBeaker** - a safe and fast code execution platform designed as middleware infrastructure for integrating code execution capabilities into your applications.

<!-- truncate -->

## What is CodeBeaker?

CodeBeaker is a production-ready infrastructure platform that provides:

- **Multi-Runtime Architecture**: Support for Docker, Deno, and Bun runtimes with intelligent automatic selection
- **High Performance**: Session reuse for 50-75% performance improvement, with native runtimes offering 11-40x faster startup
- **Real-time Streaming**: WebSocket-based JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol for bidirectional communication
- **Production Infrastructure**: Kubernetes health checks, Prometheus metrics, and comprehensive observability

## Key Features

### üöÄ Multiple Language Support

Execute code in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and C# with optimal runtime selection based on your requirements:

- **Docker Runtime**: Maximum isolation for production workloads
- **Deno Runtime**: Lightning-fast JavaScript/TypeScript execution (~80ms startup)
- **Bun Runtime**: Ultra-fast JavaScript/TypeScript execution (~50ms startup)

### üìä Dual Protocol Support

- **REST API**: Simple one-off code execution
- **WebSocket JSON-RPC**: Advanced session management and real-time streaming

### üõ°Ô∏è Infrastructure-First Design

CodeBeaker is designed as middleware, not an end-user application:

- Health check endpoints for Kubernetes integration
- Prometheus metrics for observability
- Session management for resource efficiency
- Docker-based isolation for security

## Getting Started

Check out our [documentation](/docs/intro) to get started with CodeBeaker!

## Project Status

**Current Version**: v1.2.0 (Phase 5 Complete)
**Status**: Production Ready üöÄ

We've completed:
- Phase 1-5: Core functionality, performance optimization, and benchmarking
- 17/17 integration tests passing
- Full documentation and deployment guides

## What's Next?

We're focusing on infrastructure concerns:
- Enhanced monitoring and observability
- Production deployment best practices
- Performance optimization and scaling guides
